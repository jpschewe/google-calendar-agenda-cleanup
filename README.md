This project addresses a missing feature in Google Calendar.  The print
dialog allows one to turn on and off many of the items on the calendar,
however it does not allow you to remove the calendar name that is applied
to all entries.

I had a need to print a Google Calendar in agenda view as a PDF on a
regular basis and didn't want the calendar name to show up on every entry.
This project takes as input a PDF from Google Calendar in agenda view and
hides the blocks that have the calendar name.

You can build with `gradle build` or run with `gradle run`.
